            <p>"I am extremely grateful to Casey for removing a large, dead pine tree between my carport and neighbor's fence. I had anxieties over possible problems due to such tight quarters, yet the branches and trunk were removed without incident. Casey is very knowledgeable in many aspects of tree care services. Overgrown bushes were also removed from the top of my garage. I appreciated his advice in clearing this area. The price was very reasonable. Cleanup was fantastic also. Timp Trees is where I'll will be going for my future tree needs."</p>

            <p>"They arrived on time and were very knowledgeable about trees. They cut down a 76 foot Poplar and a 60 foot Aspen in a well thought out manner that was safe. Casey was very friendly and answered all the questions we had. They cleaned up all the tree debris and cuttings so well that you wouldn't know that they had been there. The price charged was very reasonable and we were happy to pay it when we saw the quality of their work. I will use their services again and recommend them to friends."</p>

            <p>"Timp Trees did a fantastic job of removing several tall dead trees for us and making all the trees around our property healthy. The trees were next to our garden and he made sure to take extra care and not damage anything in the process. They even cleaned up the sawdust that fell on the yard. Plus, they hauled everything away, and cleaned up our property better than it was when they arrived. Casey is easy to work with and I highly recommend his tree service."</p>

            <p>"Absolutely delighted with Timp Trees. Casey gave me a bid that came in a little below another bid, and then his work was professional, prompt, and excellent. He and his crew were friendly and cleaned up beautifully after a couple of big tree removals and again after a couple of tree plantings. It was enjoyable working with people who really care about trees and Casey gave me helpful advice on how to care for my new ones. I highly recommend Timp Trees and will use them again in the future."</p>

            <p>"These guys did a great job! They trimmed my tree exactly the way I asked them. They even asked me if everything looked the way I wanted before they finished and then did the things I suggested before they left. This was great since I had very specific concerns about the tree hanging too low over a walking path behind us and had a neighbor concerned with the tree branches coming into her yard. They cleaned up all the trimmings for me too. All this for a great price!"</p>
